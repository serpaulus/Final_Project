# Predict the Final Home Price

### General Deliverables

#### Topic - Predict the final price of each home in Ames, Iowa

The topic was chosen by consensus. Most of the team members had interest on FinTech related topics, and this project appealed to all. It also has a very practical application.

#### Data Source

The data was obtained from a active Kaggle challenge to predict the final price of homes in the city of Ames, Iowa, and consists of:

   - [Test data set](https://github.com/serpaulus/Final_Project/blob/main/Data_Sets/test.csv)

   - [Train data set](https://github.com/serpaulus/Final_Project/blob/main/Data_Sets/train.csv)

Description

   - [Qualitative summary](https://github.com/serpaulus/Final_Project/blob/main/Data_Sets/kaggle_data_description.txt)

   - [Test metadata summary](https://github.com/serpaulus/Final_Project/blob/main/Data_Sets/tst_desc.csv)

   - [Train metadata summary](https://github.com/serpaulus/Final_Project/blob/main/Data_Sets/train_desc.csv)

 
 ### Proposed questions to answer 
    
   1)	What is the predicted final price of each home on the test sample?

   2)	What can the prediction results be compared against?

   3)	What is the level of accuracy?

   4)	What factors affect the model accuracy?

   5)	What Home features affect the home prices the most in the prediction model?


  ### Communication protocols
  
 The team will communicate via mainly via Slack and Zoom when required. 

 As much as possible branch merges will be coordinated with team members

 Updates via Slack and request collaboration in a timely manner to minimise delays 

 Leads will be the primary developers in their deliverables, and will submit their deliverable branch; howerver, all team members will try to 
 assist whenever it requested
        
    
 ### GitHub Deliverables 
     
 [X] Main Branch includes a README.md

 [X] At least one branch for each team member

 [X] Each team member has at least four commits from the duration of the first segment


 ### Machine Learning Model Deliverables
 

Team members present a provisional machine learning model that stands in for the final machine learning model and accomplishes the following:
 
[x] Takes in data in from the provisional database

### Database Deliverables


Team members present a provisional database that stands in for the final database and accomplishes the following: 
 
[x] Sample data that mimics the expected final database structure or schema
