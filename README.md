# Predict the Final Home Price

## Segment 1

### General Deliverables

#### Topic - Predict the final price of each home in Ames, Iowa

The topic was chosen by consensus. Most of team had interest on FinTech related topics, and this project appealed to all. It also has a very practical application.

#### Data Source

The data was obtained from a active Kaggle challenge to predict the final price of homes in the city of Ames, Iowa, and consists of:

   - [Test data set](https://github.com/serpaulus/Final_Project/blob/main/Data_Sets/test.csv)

   - [Train data set](https://github.com/serpaulus/Final_Project/blob/main/Data_Sets/train.csv)

Description

   - [Qualitative summary](https://github.com/serpaulus/Final_Project/blob/main/Data_Sets/kaggle_data_description.txt)

   - [Test metadata summary](https://github.com/serpaulus/Final_Project/blob/main/Data_Sets/tst_desc.csv)

   - [Train metadata summary]()

 
   
    
    [X] Proposed questions to answer 
    
        1)	What is the predicted final price of each home on the test sample?

        2)	What can the prediction results be compared against?

        3)	What is the level of accuracy?

        4)	What factors affect the model accuracy?

        5)	What Home features affect the home prices the most in the prediction model?


  ### Communication protocols
  
    The team will communicate via mainly via Slack and Zoom when required. 
    
    As much as possible branch merges will be coordinated with team members
    
    Updates via Slack and request collaboration in a timely manner to minimise delays 
    
    Leads will be the primary developers in their deliverables, and will submit their deliverable branch; howerver, all team members will try to 
    assist whenever it requested
